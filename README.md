# Flutter-PointEV
Graduation project on Gebze Technical University. I’ll develop a mobile application for restaurants, markets, stores etc that will allow “free” electric car charging outlets for EV to incoming customers.


** Free E-Charge Community App

The mobile app will be used both by customers and stores. Customer should be able to list and view status of charging outlet based on geographic location and make notification prior to arrival to store/restaurant owner. 

Charge outlets are 3.7 Kw / 7.4 Kw simple home type outlets with no inteligent control systems added by stores.
